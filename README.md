Alternative dark mode made for personal use. The stylesheet is meant for use with Rift Dark.

Install [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) and install [the stylesheet](https://github.com/Kractero/ns-stylus-theme-dumps/raw/main/dark-mod.user.styl), optionally also install the [userscript](https://github.com/Kractero/ns-stylus-theme-dumps/raw/main/card-overwrite.user.js) with any userscript manager if you want light mode card styles.

## CSS Variables

The stylesheet is configurable with the css variables at the top. By default it is using Catppuccin Mocha's color palette. You can switch out the palette for different colors.

Changing the font can be done by altering the specified value in --font-family, but you may need to figure out how to import the font you want.

## Legality

>Your tool may freely customize everything that affects the look (but not the layout) of any NationStates page (including prohibited page items). This includes fonts, colors, margins, paddings, borders, and more. Note, however, that we don't make any assurances (beyond those explicitly listed in these rules) about the format and markup of any part of the site, and they can change at any time without any notice.

This is just CSS, it doesn't change the behavior of anything. 

## Philosophy

1. Higher contrast
2. Whiter text
3. Not necessarily a straight up black background
4. Remove weird padding and stylistic changes from lightmode
5. Green text for links on dark mode look hideous
6. Don't dim my flag or banner
